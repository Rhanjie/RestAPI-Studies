<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project consists in providing a REST API for a sample library database in order to be able to use the data in a mobile and web applications to facilitate readers' access to the book database with a convenient interface that will display information such as the date the books were borrowed, the final return date, the stock and any penalties.

Our aim is to develop our programming skills in practice, so creating a project like this is an opportunity for us to make the world better. (XD)

```

To use the H2 database, go to the appropriate address and log in without changing the default credentials:
```
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
```

To use the Swagger tool to test the available endpoints, go to the address below:
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/
```
